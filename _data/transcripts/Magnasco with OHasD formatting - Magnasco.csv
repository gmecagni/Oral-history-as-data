0:04,Interviewer:,"We are continuing on side two, and you were telling the story, Anne, about when Ted and Joan Kennedy were canvassing.",
0:12,Anne:,"Yeah, they were on Bromfield Street. So I worked there about 12 years...",
0:19,Interviewer:,At Purcell's.,
0:20,Anne:,"At Purcell's, by that time, my children were growing up now.",
0:25,Interviewer:,Right.,
0:26,Anne:,"But I worked such long hours, I'd go in at 11. I'd work long days and then short days, then go back at 5. And there wasn't that many restaurants in town at the time, and I worked very hard there, I worked this long bar, and the kitchen was on PI Alley, go School Street to PI Alley Lounge, I'd go with big trays down the stairs... I went down to 117 pounds.",
0:59,Interviewer:,Oh my goodness.,
0:59,Anne:,"I worked so hard there, and then, I'd get through there and then go and set up for banquets and work banquets. And I wasn't making money! I was getting 55 cents an hour, and you get quarters and so forth. I would have lawyers... in fact, we would work in the Legal Lightroom, barely, it was just starting to just come into the lawyers... see this was a lawyers' room. Only lawyers could go there. And Lee F. Bailey, the lawyer-",
1:34,Interviewer:,L.F. Bailey.,
1:35,Anne:,"F.L. Bailey. He was just starting, and he would be in the room a lot.",
1:39,Interviewer:,"Oh, so did you have a chance to talk to him?",
1:45,Anne:,"Oh well, they were another cheap ... you know?",
1:47,Interviewer:,That's what you said [crosstalk 00:01:48].,
1:49,Anne:,"And I would have a group come in every Wednesday night, about seven of them, and they were antique dealers, judges, and they'd come in, they'd have their dinner, they'd go downstairs and bowl. There's a bowling alley downstairs. And if I had $3 from the seven of them, I was fortunate. And they'd come back after bowling and go upstairs, we had a balcony, and you were supposed to run up there with your cocktails, and crackers and so forth. And I had a waitress I worked with. I went up one day and they said... one night, and worked so hard, and they said, ""You know Margie just bought us a round, how bout you?""",
2:39,Anne:,"I was, look, I'm here to earn a living for three children, I'm not here to buy drinks for anybody. Asking me, and there they are. Well, anyway, that's being a waitress.",
2:52,Interviewer:,"So I worked there at that time, and I was fed up because I couldn't get Saturday's off. New girls were coming in and getting Saturdays off, and I never saw my children. Next thing I knew, I turned around and they were grown up. And that to this day I carry guilt with me, to think I missed so much of their childhood. And I cry about it to this day, I do. Even if they did have, like my Mary Joe, she's the youngest, and she felt it the most. There was my sister and the kids in the house. But my sister was lucky anyway. She had this woman, I tell my sister today, you had a nanny, I didn't for my children. And she lived there, this friend of ours, her mother passed away, and she lived there, I mean, she was there for the kids. And my Mary Joe, she felt it terrible, to this day.",
3:52,Anne:,"Well, after I left... I couldn't take Purcell's anymore. And I should have left Purcell's years ago. I should have. Because when I had to go back on a split shift, I'd see everyone going home. ""Oh, why can't I got home? Oh, to be able to go home!"" But all I had to do was quit and leave and go! But I didn't want to go on welfare. My Mary Joe said to me, ""You should have went on welfare so you'd be home!"" But Mary Joe, welfare wasn't welfare today. I says, they gave you nothing, nothing at all.",
4:28,New Speaker:,"Right, they'd pay you peanuts [crosstalk].",
4:30,Anne:,"So from there, I went back to the airport for a short time. I left them, I couldn't stay on account of this manager. We had a new manager. I couldn't even go to the hairdresser, my brother was so ill in the hospital, I couldn't go to see him. I says, this is it. And that was union! That was union!",
4:51,Interviewer:,You were union at Purcell's?,
4:52,Anne:,"Oh, yes! I had union. And so I left, I lost wages, I never bothered to look into, I paid into the union dues. Never thought of that until years later and the union went out of business. We had local... 27... bartender's and waitresses union. That was gone. And then I went to work in East Boston.",
5:17,Interviewer:,Oh.,
5:18,Anne:,Back. I went to Jeveli's.,
5:22,Interviewer:,Jeveli's!,
5:23,Anne:,And that was the best place I ever worked.,
5:24,Interviewer:,"Oh, that's so good. Tell us more about Jeveli's.",
5:28,Anne:,"At Jeveli's, they had the bar side and they had this other woman. Meggie, Fanny, made another one. And I worked the bar. What's sad is, this is something that my children were growing up in. And from there, I worked and they built another one. And I didn't want to work nights, girls made plenty of money at night.",
5:49,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
5:50,Anne:,"Girls made plenty. I wanted days. But I had a wonderful clientele from the airport, businessmen, I had them all. And I was the only girl Mr. Jeveli would not change my station, because he said I had nine tables. I had seven booths too, seven at night, and- almost ten. And then we had a big table if no one could... it was a spare table, it could hold five or six people, and that was open. But I always ended up getting that table. And I worked days and I liked working there, and I had a good boss. Because when I worked at Purcell's, the manager and chef at that place was my bother's brother-in-law. And he wouldn't even let you have a hamburger.",
6:39,Interviewer:,"Oh, he wouldn't feed you.",
6:42,Anne:,"Oh, he wouldn't feed you. If it wasn't for this black fellow, Malcolm, who'd make club sandwiches and sneak them out to us so we could eat. And one time we had a meeting in Purcell's, and this chef, who's passed away now, my brother's brother-in-law! Is like ""You girls don't know what it is to have to cream or butter, you'll waste it."" He was one of these, watched you every second. ""You don't know what it is, you've never had cream or butter until you come here."" And I looked at him, I said ""I had it before you ever did, mister."" My father made sure we always had butter and cream from the restaurant. During the Depression, there was s teaks, there was everything in the house. The only thing is we were rationed off for shoes and certain things we had to ration.",
7:31,Anne:,"So I went to Purcell's, and I liked it there-",
7:34,Interviewer:,"You went to Jeveli's, you mean.",
7:36,Anne:,I mean Jeveli's.,
7:36,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
7:39,Anne:,"And I liked it very much, and I worked days. Well, I started off working nights, and then I went to days. Because I like day work. Although they closed the [inaudible 00:07:52], I worked some nights there, I did until they opened up another one. And I had a wonderful clientele, I had Mr. Hill, he owned half of the airport.",
8:03,Interviewer:,Oh really?,
8:04,Anne:,Oh yeah. He took over on selling the lobsters at the airport.,
8:12,Interviewer:,The what?,
8:12,Anne:,"The lobster shop. At the airport. And they would come in, and I had all the men from a machinery place down in Boylston, it's still there, Wigglesworth. And it's still there. They all came in at five and six and seven. And all you got from them was a quarter, that's all they got. So when they came in we had the soups, Jeveli had soup. ""Anne, make sure you dip the dipper down low and get up the..."" Yeah, you know-",
8:46,Interviewer:,Where all the meat is.,
8:48,Anne:,"So when I left Jeveli's, that other waitress says ""She waited on Wigglesworth,"" and they says, ""You know, Anne used to-""",
8:57,Interviewer:,Do this for us.,
8:57,Anne:,"She says ""I'm sorry to tell you, Anne took the dipper home with her.""",
9:02,Interviewer:,Good line. Very good line.,
9:04,Anne:,"She took the ladle home. So I worked for Jeveli's all that time, and I waited on Ted Kennedy there, again.",
9:13,Interviewer:,How was Mr. Kennedy?,
9:15,Anne:,"And I waited on him. Well a call came in, and they says, they're requesting Anne to wait on-- Mr. Kennedy's coming in as guests. So I couldn't understand how... is it hard for you to hear this?",
9:31,Interviewer:,"It's a little... I'm just wondering, let me pause one second-",
9:34,Interviewer:,"Right, so, this call came in.",
9:36,Anne:,"And Mr. Jeveli says ""You're requested to wait, Ted Kennedy's coming in."" And I says...",
9:42,Interviewer:,He knew your name!,
9:43,Anne:,"Yeah, well now I'll tell you why, though. So after I served them all, I think Ted Kennedy gave me $7, picked up the tab.",
9:52,Interviewer:,That's good.,
9:53,Anne:,"And so I reminded him of waiting on him in the Harvard Room. He's all ""Yes!"" You know? I don't think he remembered, but he said it anyway. And then after that, oh -- the girls, you know, waitresses are funny people. Goes, ""How come you had Ted Kennedy?"" Well, I used to wait on this gentleman, Mr. John Mustariony, he had his own business here in East Boston, and I was a steady waiting. And he recommended Jeveli's, and he said ""And when you go, you ask for tall, blonde,"" and that's what, there was another Anna there, and I was Anne, ""You ask for tall, blonde Anne.""",
10:38,Interviewer:,And that's you.,
10:40,Anne:,"And that was me. So I waited on Ted Kennedy there. And then I took ill, I had to have surgery. And I was going to go back for two, no. My sister Edie decided to retire from the [inaudible 00:10:56], she worked at a factory in the North End, and it was horrible. It was like a factory [inaudible 00:11:06]. She had an employer who was not nice to the girls at all. I said ""I don't know how you stay there."" Mr. Jeveli was a man that respected... he never said much, he never complained, but you had to eat for lunch. And girls would eat everything. I ate fish every day. That was my main course.",
11:26,Interviewer:,That sounds good.,
11:27,Anne:,"And she's says ""I'll retire."" She says ""Why don't you retire, too?"" Now, I'm 72 years old",
11:33,Interviewer:,Oh my goodness.,
11:33,Anne:,At the time. 73.,
11:39,Interviewer:,Wow. Wow. Right now?,
11:43,Anne:,"No, I'm 83.",
11:43,Interviewer:,You're 83?,
11:43,Anne:,No one believes it.,
11:44,Interviewer:,"No, you look great, Anne.",
11:50,Anne:,"No, I'm 83 years old. When I go into the doctor's-",
11:51,Interviewer:,Yeah?,
11:51,Anne:,"And they look at me. ""You sure?""",
11:56,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
11:57,Anne:,"I says, ""I am."" In fact, I fell in the house two months ago. I tripped- my slipper twisted and I went down. I just come home from church, and I grabbed that chair, but my body fell on my foot. Not on the ankle, I missed, and it still is kind of sore.",
12:17,Anne:,"And I let it go, I- but the pain increased so much, so I finally went to the Winthrop, we have a hospital in Winthrop. They have a clinic here, but I went to Winthrop. And so they took me in for an X-ray, and the radiologist kept looking at me and looking at me, and he says to me, ""Are you 83 years old?""",
12:38,Anne:,"I says, ""Yes, I am.""",
12:39,Anne:,"He's all, ""I kept looking at your record. I don't believe it.""",
12:43,Anne:,"Cause, you know, I've been in this business 22 years, and I know what 83 year-old person looks like.""",
12:49,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
12:49,Anne:,"He goes, ""You must have led a good life.""",
12:51,Anne:,"I says, ""Well, I was a waitress all my life, you know?""",
12:54,Anne:,"He says, ""God bless you."" You know, he couldn't get over it. So I laughed, even to the doctor, I had something done a few months ago in the hospital, [inaudible 00:13:03].",
13:02,Anne:,"So Edie says-- I says, ""Oh, I don't know."" And right in the moment I went, ""Teddy, I'm retiring.""",
13:15,Anne:,"He says, ""Why?""",
13:17,Anne:,"And his wife, she's very nice, Muriel, she's, ""Work two days a week.""",
13:23,Interviewer:,They didn't want to let you go.,
13:24,Anne:,"Yeah, because it was so abrupt, but that was the biggest mistake of my life I made. Because I wasn't ready to retire. I still had it. You know, I could work, and cause we were our own cashiers there, I carried money in my pocket all the time, and that was my biggest mistake. Right after that, I found out I had to have surgery. So living in the hospital and I came out and so Teddy says,",
13:58,Anne:,"Anne, why don't you take life easy now?",
14:00,Anne:,"And I said, ""Well, maybe I can't do it."" But I know I could have done it. I could have done it, because I recuperated fast.",
14:09,Anne:,"So that was the end of Jeveli's, but I was sorry that I said I'd retire because my sister says to retire. And I wasn't- she was, but I wasn't ready. People today have to make sure if they're ready to retire. Your heart will tell you. And I wasn't.",
14:27,Anne:,"Well, that's passé now. And so I left there, and then after a while things got boring. Because I walked, hiked, walked, I was always on my legs. My doctor told me I have strong legs after 50 years of being a waitress.",
14:48,Interviewer:,"Yeah, waitressing [crosstalk 00:14:49]. You have great legs.",
14:51,Anne:,"And he said that's because, you know, walking. We do a lot of walking after that. But my sister can't do it any more, because she gets very, very tired. We would walk to Revere, walk to...",
15:06,Interviewer:,Really?,
15:07,Anne:,"Oh, yeah, Winthrop. We walked everywhere.",
15:07,Interviewer:,"I have some questions, here, you have to get back, because now- I want to know about the neighborhood. East Boston. Because you've worked around different parts.",
15:20,Anne:,"Ah, okay.",
15:21,Interviewer:,"But, well, let's get to Wood Island Park.",
15:25,Anne:,Right.,
15:26,Interviewer:,Because you were saying that you hung out there as a teenager.,
15:30,Anne:,"Well, I hung there all my life.",
15:31,Interviewer:,"All your life? Okay, so tell us some of your earliest recollections of going there.",
15:36,Anne:,"Earliest recollection is, I was very small, I was young. My mother would take us to Wood Island Park, she would send us and then she would come at 12, we'd be in the water playing, and she would come at 12 with two big, heavy bags, and we were Italian people, and macaroni, and we'd be like little chicks all running out of the water, and she'd have all this food for us every day. At that time Wood Island Park had two bath houses. One was for the men, and one for women. We had a raft for the men and a raft for the women.",
16:11,Interviewer:,What do you mean a raft?,
16:11,Anne:,"Rafts, you could swim out and climb in a raft out in the water.",
16:15,Interviewer:,But they were separate. You- [crosstalk 00:16:17] what happened if-,
16:18,Anne:,"No, no. Separate. One there and one- no. It didn't make any difference. But that was- and those we didn't buy bathing suits, we rented them.",
16:28,Interviewer:,From who?,
16:29,Anne:,"From Wood Island Park, from the City of Boston.",
16:31,Interviewer:,For how much?,
16:32,Anne:,Five cents.,
16:33,Interviewer:,Oh my goodness.,
16:33,Anne:,"They were canvas bags. Exactly canvas bags. Big black things with the City of Boston- and they always smelt of a, what do you say, a germicide of some kind on it.",
16:49,Interviewer:,"Oh, right! For the hygiene!",
16:51,Anne:,"Right. And big black- when I think of it, and a lot of older women would wear black stockings in the water-",
17:04,Interviewer:,That's right.,
17:05,Anne:,"They'd be wearing stockings and wading, and we'd jump and- we'd get a kick out of it. The way they would get together and sing a song. And after the tide went out, we would dig for clams.",
17:20,Interviewer:,"Oh, you did?",
17:21,Anne:,Yeah.,
17:21,Interviewer:,And you'd eat them. I mean-,
17:22,Anne:,"After we'd cook them. Yeah, they had cans. Make a little fire-",
17:27,Interviewer:,"Oh, you'd cook them right there?",
17:29,Anne:,"Right there. Right! And containers, the women would lose their stockings in the water, we'd use the stockings and put the clams, to carry them. When I think of it...",
17:41,Interviewer:,How wonderful though.,
17:42,Anne:,"Yeah, and there's no airport.",
17:45,Interviewer:,"Okay, this is what we want to talk about, right-",
17:47,Anne:,There's no airport-,
17:48,Interviewer:,Until?,
17:54,Anne:,"There was one hut where the whole airport is now, it was like a handsome hut, serviceman, one. And I think there was one plane, I think it was a private plane. And I recall sitting there as a young girl, we had a narrow-gauge train come in, right by Wood Island Park, and I recall sitting on the grass, and the plane got caught in the wires or something at that time. With only small little planes, planes were starting to become kind of popular, at the time.",
18:31,Interviewer:,"This was what, 1940s?",
18:32,Anne:,"No, no, no.",
18:32,Interviewer:,Still 30s?,
18:36,Anne:,"No, 30s. Early 30s.",
18:39,Interviewer:,Early 30s. So around the time Amelia Earhart flew.,
18:42,Anne:,"Yeah, it was early 30s when they had the bath houses and the rafts. And the trees, and the bushes. It was so huge, Wood Island Park.",
18:53,Interviewer:,"It was- okay, very green.",
18:55,Anne:,"Oh, everything was green, Beautiful, you could see the water, you could see the boats coming by. And when the train would come by with the whistle, and it was such a pleasant, nice feeling. And we would walk from Meridian Street to Wood Island, it would be about a mile, you know. And my mother would walk with those bags from, when I think of it, in that hot sun, because you came down the strip of Putman Street, I think it was, no houses or anything, it was all marshes on each side.",
19:28,Interviewer:,And was it paved then?,
19:30,Anne:,"No, it was-",
19:31,Interviewer:,A path.,
19:33,Anne:,"A path, you know. And it would be marshes with cattails going- cat-o'-nine-tails, all that stuff in the marshes.",
19:39,Interviewer:,Sure.,
19:40,Anne:,"As you went by. And you had the one little store at the- just before you got into Wood Island, we had to cross a bridge. And there'd be a little store that sold pickles, it had wooden floors and pickles and little canned stuff, candy and stuff.",
19:53,Interviewer:,What was the store's name?,
19:55,Anne:,"I couldn't remember, I was too young. Too young. But Island Park then had swings, beautiful swings. Then they had, as you went further, where they played tennis, and they had a building where you'd go and take showers, and they played ball, and then going further- you could really get lost in Wood Island Park, you know? Run across the strip and... you know, you could explore it.",
20:26,Interviewer:,Okay.,
20:27,Anne:,At that- in those days.,
20:28,Interviewer:,The part that was more... internal.,
20:31,Anne:,Yeah.,
20:31,Interviewer:,Right.,
20:32,Anne:,"The further in- you'd just go, you walked all around. It was quite a huge place. And it didn't have barbecues or anything-",
20:41,Interviewer:,You couldn't have.,
20:42,Anne:,"No. No, no they were unheard of, a barbecue. And we enjoyed it, and as I kept getting older and older, we still enjoyed it. And I was saying, all my girlfriends and I, we took a walk- you walked to Wood Island Park! It was such a beautiful sight, and the sun, and the moon would come up high, you wouldn't dare to do it today.",
21:07,Interviewer:,Right.,
21:08,Anne:,"I mean, we were safe.",
21:09,Interviewer:,Right.,
21:09,Anne:,"Oh, everything was so safe in those days. And, what else about Wood Island? And then I get older and all the fellows and girls were in a group and we'd leave every day. And it was time to go home, 5 o'clock we all made a dive to get home-",
21:25,Interviewer:,To pray for your family dinner.,
21:27,Anne:,"Yes, exactly. We learned how to smoke. So a woman came to my mother's home one day and she says, ""I saw your daughter at Wood Island Park, and you know she was smoking?""",
21:38,Anne:,"My mother says, ""Well, if she's not doing anything else, smoking isn't too bad."" You know?",
21:42,Interviewer:,It's true! [crosstalk 00:21:43],
21:42,Anne:,"She says, ""As long as she just smokes, I'm not worried."" But she was angry. And then I met my husband. And couples will, fellows and girls were just starting to go steady and then, you know, get married.",
22:03,Interviewer:,"Yeah, they would probably hang out at the park.",
22:05,Anne:,"Right, right. Then they took half of the park away. They took all this park away. Half of- [crosstalk 00:22:16]",
22:16,Interviewer:,"Part of the [crosstalk 00:22:17] of the internal park, and that was when they started to pave it over for the airport?",
22:21,Anne:,The airport. They start taking away-,
22:23,Interviewer:,"Go ahead. In the 40s, was this-",
22:25,Anne:,"Yeah, they started- no, before the 40s. Yeah, about the 40s.",
22:30,Anne:,Early 40s.,
22:30,Interviewer:,"Early 40s, they started. [crosstalk 00:22:32]",
22:31,Interviewer:,About the time of the second war started.,
22:34,Anne:,"Right. Yes. And we were sold down the river. People didn't know how to protest in those days. And they did it without people knowing. Mr. Volpe, he was one of them. He was the governor of Massachusetts at that time. And they named one of these terminals after him down at the airport. But he had a lot to do with it. And by degrees, they took that whole park away and they left this other piece that we'd explore- it was away from the main park- and they took the rest of it.",
23:13,Anne:,There was no more Wood Island Park.,
23:16,Interviewer:,"So when you say they took it away, they just- [crosstalk 00:23:18]",
23:18,Anne:,"They took it for the airport, they, they took it for the airport. So the airport kept building and building and building. And they extend it out to there, and we had an island called Governor's Island, and that's gone. They went as far as into there, they started to take everything. The airport became a big place.",
23:39,Interviewer:,"Right. I heard, so you were on the airport, on the field in the early days, when-",
23:47,Anne:,"Oh, yeah. Where the airport is.",
23:48,Interviewer:,When you could just walk on the airstrip and it was actually a very small little strip.,
23:53,Anne:,"Yeah. Well, it was nothing to walk on. Outside of that little closet hut they had there, the kids would go- it was a strip, away from the water, the kids would go ball, they called it- dive in the water with no clothes on.",
24:10:00,Interviewer:,"Oh, yes.",
24:10:00,Anne:,"No one could see them. Because it was out towards where the airport is. And gradually, it was all taken. There was nothing left. So what they gave us... this little beach up here, called Constitution Beach?",
24:23:00,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
24:24:00,Anne:,We called it Shay's Beach at first. Now it's Constitution. Horrible.,
24:29:00,Interviewer:,Really?,
24:30:00,Anne:,"Horrible. You don't get the waves. You get the dead water that comes in, like a cove. We lost all that. I never go up there.",
24:39:00,Interviewer:,Because it's on the inside of the harbor. It's not outside on the ocean.,
24:44:00,Anne:,"In the cove. And you get that dead water. You don't get waves like Revere Beach any other beach. So that was the end of Wood Island Park, to everyone's sorrow. In fact, I have a picture of teenagers lying on the big rock over at Wood Island Park. You know, my girlfriends...photographs.",
25:03:00,Anne:,"It's all gone. [inaudible] But we didn't know how to fight for things. Protest like they do today, none of that. So if you wanted to go anywhere, you went to Revere Beach.",
25:16:00,Anne:,"But now East Boston, when I was a little girl, Meridian Street, I lived in Meridian Street, but as you went towards Chelsea, just before you get into Chelsea there was a bath house. Beautiful bath house for, one was for men and one was for women. And I barely remember it, and I recall going in it and someone pulled me in the water, and I remember screaming because I, I don't think I knew how to swim at the time. That's how young I was. And people don't know that there was a bath house, never know there was a bath house on the right side before you went into Chelsea.",
25:54:00,Anne:,"If you look up the history of East Boston, they probably have something about a bath house being there.",
26:01:00,Interviewer:,Right. Where was the water? What part of the-,
26:03:00,Anne:,"Yeah, we called it Chelsea Creek. That's where the water was, now there's all those boats and things up there now. Up in Meridian Street. That's East Boston. Further up going in the direction of Chelsea.",
26:18:00,Interviewer:,Okay.,
26:19:00,Anne:,"I don't know if you- there's a bridge, are you familiar with that part of... no-",
26:25:00,Interviewer:,"Okay, but keep talking, because people are going to be familiar.",
26:30:00,Anne:,"And there's Chelsea Bridge, the old Chelsea Bridge, now they have a new bridge they built years ago, and that was another hangout for teenagers. There was an ice cream store on Meridian Street, that was a big treat. Getting ice cream and all walking up to the bridge. And hanging on the bridge.",
26:48:00,Interviewer:,And underneath the bridge.,
26:49:00,Anne:,No. On the bridge.,
26:51:00,Interviewer:,On the bridge.,
26:52:00,Anne:,"On the bridge. The railing and all. And we'd stay on it. And if a ship had to come by, the bridge had to turn around, we'd stay on it. And the bridge would go all the way around. They had old wrecks of schooners, there was one great big schooner wreck, and I always remember the bow of it, of a woman's face, you know on the bow?",
27:16:00,Interviewer:,Sure.,
27:16:00,Anne:,"Of that, it was a wreck. My eldest brother would climb to the top of the bridge, of the girders? If my mother ever knew it, she would have died. And he'd dive off of it. And I'd hold my breath, I'd be so frightened for my oldest brother, he would dive off that bridge. But we enjoyed- we'd walk up there almost [inaudible 00:27:39], that was our recreation. Walking to the bridge, getting an ice cream cone. Not like today, what goes on.",
27:46:00,Interviewer:,Right.,
27:47:00,Anne:,"Horrible things. And that was pleasure. That was great pleasure. But Wood Island Park, we all missed it. My children- part of me was still there when my little girls were small, they were too small, they were small, you know, I'd go down there with the baby carriage and then-",
28:06:00,Interviewer:,Play on the swings? [crosstalk 00:28:08],
28:08:00,Anne:,"[crosstalk 00:28:08] -Prescott Street, I went to the Prescott. And then the city, King at the time I start taking all the houses on Prescott Street, it was a beautiful street. Beautiful three-deckers. Buying them out for the airport.",
28:23:00,Interviewer:,So they actually took away some neighborhoods in addition-,
28:25:00,Anne:,"They took a lot of neighborhood out. One house is still there, refused to move. Refused to get out.",
28:32:00,Interviewer:,On Prescott Street.,
28:33:00,Anne:,Prescott Street.,
28:34:00,Interviewer:,What number? Do you know-,
28:36:00,Anne:,"Oh, I wouldn't know, but it's nearer to- if you come off the ramp, you might see it. It's still there. And that house is still there. They took all of Prescott and they took parts of Bennington Street, the little houses, it's the Wood Island Station now.",
28:52:00,Interviewer:,Yeah! So then the subway came through at a certain point in the 50s.,
28:56:00,Anne:,"Well, the subway, I was a little girl when they built Maverick Station. Because my mother, we would take the train- we had streetcars, double streetcars. Back then they would stop right in front of my mother's house. That was a stop right there. And then that would take you to Maverick, you got off and you took the ferryboat. There was no tunnel. There was no subway. And we took the ferryboat into Boston.",
29:27:00,Interviewer:,For how much?,
29:28:00,Anne:,One penny.,
29:28:00,Interviewer:,"Yeah, that was the Penny Ferry.",
29:30:00,Anne:,"Penny, it was a beautiful little ride back and forth on the ferry.",
29:34:00,Interviewer:,About how long would the ride take?,
29:36:00,Anne:,"Fifteen minutes? It was a nice [inaudible 00:29:39], it was beautiful. I loved it. My mother would take us on the ferryboat and we'd go into the North End. There was a South Ferry and the North Ferry. We would- we took the North Ferry, cause that's the part of the North End we wanted to go to.",
29:56:00,Interviewer:,What part of the North End would that-,
29:58:00,Anne:,"That would lead you like Hanover Street, and up around that way.",
30:02:00,Interviewer:,"Right, and the South Ferry would-",
30:02:00,Anne:,South Ferry I think took you further down the other end. Atlantic Avenue.,
30:07:00,Interviewer:,Right.,
30:08:00,Anne:,"Right. And then they took the ferryboats away. And they start building the tunnel. Now, I'm a teenager then. My girlfriend and I, her boyfriend went to work in the tunnel, he sandblasted. He almost lost his eyesight. And when they built that, they stopped the narrow-gauge- they didn't need the narrow-gauge train anymore, cause the train used to come in and let you off to take the ferry.",
30:43:00,Anne:,"The narrow-gauge came as far as Maverick, where the ferryboats were.",
30:50:00,Interviewer:,"Okay, so-",
30:50:00,Anne:,"And left the people from Lynn, Revere, the North Shore.",
30:54:00,Interviewer:,Right.,
30:54:00,Anne:,And they'd get off and take the ferryboat.,
30:56:00,Interviewer:,"And what, so you'd just cross the street from the train-",
31:01:00,Anne:,So when you'd get off the train-,
31:02:00,Interviewer:,At Maverick Station.,
31:03:00,Anne:,"There was no trains in [crosstalk 00:31:05]. But the narrow-gauge train, the streetcar, and then you had to walk down-",
31:11:00,Interviewer:,A couple blocks.,
31:11:00,Anne:,We walked a quarter of a mile to the ferry. And then you took the ferry.,
31:17:00,Interviewer:,I see how that fits together.,
31:20:00,Anne:,"Right. And my mother, we would play down at the park. The park was one of my homes, Central Square.",
31:28:00,Interviewer:,Sure.,
31:29:00,Anne:,"And she'd come to pick us up, but we never knew when she was coming, but she knew where to find us. And she'd have her hanky, and the fountain, wipe our faces off to take us to the North End.",
31:42:00,Interviewer:,"Oh, I see.",
31:43:00,Anne:,"And we'd walk to the ferry, get to the North End, and pizza's [inaudible 00:31:47], there were no pizza shops. None. If you wanted a pizza, you would to to the bread store and he made one for you. So I there was a little bread store, we'd get off the North End, and my mother would take us to this little store off Michelangelo Street, [inaudible] Hanover, Michelangelo. And he'd make a pizza, had a little, couple of chairs and one table, and she'd buy us the pizzas and tonic. That's the only time we had tonic in our house.",
32:18:00,Anne:,"And she'd say, ""Now, eat plenty because we're going visiting now, we don't know if they're going to feed you.""",
32:26:00,Anne:,"And my mother was smart that way. She said, ""Fill up. Have enough in your tummy, because might not get fed where we're going."" That was what pizzas were. You didn't go out and buy a pizza, we made pizzas at home. My mother made all these pizzas. She'd make bread dough overnight and we'd have fried dough in the morning.",
32:44:00,Interviewer:,Oh yeah.,
32:46:00,Anne:,"For breakfast. And the rest of it she'd make bread. And, where am I at now?",
32:52:00,Interviewer:,You were talking about going from the park in Central Square over to North End.,
32:58:00,Anne:,"Right, to the North End.",
32:59:00,Interviewer:,And go visiting family and friends.,
33:01:00,Anne:,"Yeah. Right, my mother had cousins there, up in Michelangelo Street. She had cousins there.",
33:08:00,Anne:,"And then, about East Boston, people don't remember, there's the Liberty Market Plaza. Now. Well, that used to be all coal.",
33:18:00,Interviewer:,Coal?,
33:19:00,Anne:,Coal companies.,
33:21:00,Interviewer:,Really?,
33:21:00,Anne:,"The City Fuel company. Coal. And they had, I'd look out my mother's window back on Meridian Street, I could see them. It was like going into a mine, and you know, and all the carts would come out of the mine, well that was what they had going around and around, put coal in it.",
33:40:00,Interviewer:,Really?,
33:41:00,Anne:,Yeah. Coal company.,
33:42:00,Interviewer:,"Nobody mentioned this. Okay. When was this, then?",
33:46:00,Anne:,"Oh, my. When I was a little girl.",
33:49:00,Interviewer:,"So, in the 20s?",
33:51:00,Anne:,"Growing up. Yeah, would be. The 20s and maybe a little older than the 20s. Maybe, no, 20s I think. And then they did oil heat come out, they started buying oil and-",
34:04:00,Interviewer:,And so the coal company just disappeared?,
34:07:00,Anne:,"Yeah. But the coal, I remember City Fuel, there was another coal company, but I can't recall the name of it. But City Fuel Coal, I remember. And that's exactly where Liberty Market Plaza is now. In there. And my brothers with their sled in the winter would go down to buy 100-pound bags of coal. But you bought coal by the ton or half-ton. And they would come and we had a cellar window-",
34:31:00,Interviewer:,Right. Coal chute.,
34:33:00,Anne:,"And put the coal down the chute. And they did away with that. And then- we have East Boston Center now, it's in East Boston Center, it's-",
34:49:00,Interviewer:,A community center?,
34:50:00,Anne:,"Yes. Used to be a beautiful church. It was an Episcopalian church, was it. I loved going to it. I'm a Catholic, my mother didn't know I was doing this. Between the Salvation Army and that, I would go because I loved- I still remember the minister's name, Father [inaudible 00:35:13], because on May Day they gave you flowers, they took you on picnics. Catholic church, all I got was- that, you know.",
35:21:00,Interviewer:,"Right. Don't do this. Slap, slap.",
35:23:00,Anne:,"Don't do this. Slap. Genuflect. And all this stuff. So, I loved the Salvation Army, and to this day-",
35:29:00,Interviewer:,What would you do there?,
35:29:00,Anne:,Salvation Army? I'd just loved going and listening to them. We were children-,
35:37:00,Interviewer:,"The band, you mean?",
35:38:00,Anne:,"When I first came to East Boston, East Boston was beautiful. Oh, it was beautiful. Which is so weird. I lived on Meridian Street, not far from the square. Five minutes? And we happened to hit the square, I was amazed, I was only a kid and I see this big drum on the floor and the people that were there. And you know, the Salvation Army was, and it attracted me to it. And then when they were through, you could follow them down to their church. Yeah, it was a block away or so, at Saratoga Street, and they would give us doughnuts. I thought it was so crazy, you know, coffee- oh no, we didn't have coffee, but we had doughnuts and so forth.",
36:24:00,Anne:,"And I liked- to this day, that's the only charity I really support. To this day, because I love the Salvation Army. And my mother says, ""What church are you going to?"" And she got angry about it, says, ""You belong to the Holy Redeemer."" But I still went. I'd go to our churches.",
36:45:00,Interviewer:,Yeah.,
36:47:00,Anne:,Today I'm a Baptist.,
36:51:00,Interviewer:,Is there a Baptist church in East Boston?,
36:53:00,Anne:,"Oh yeah, there's two of them, but I belong to this Baptist church, the minister's young- It's only eight years since in, getting together. We have a very small church up here in Saratoga Street. Now we bought a nice building down in Bremen. Near Day Square? And we've been there about two months now. So yeah, we have a nice church, a nice pastor and his wife.",
37:17:00,Interviewer:,That's great.,
37:17:00,Anne:,Yeah. So we go there.,
37:20:00,Interviewer:,"Anne, I really enjoy your stories very much. The other question they have about location is Belle Isle Marsh.",
37:29:00,Anne:,"Oh, that's up here.",
37:31:00,Interviewer:,What experiences have you had with-,
37:33:00,Anne:,"Oh, I tell you the truth, I haven't had many experiences. It's a salt water- it's a bird sanctuary or something- there's always something coming up in the East Boston papers about it.",
37:43:00,Interviewer:,Right.,
37:44:00,Anne:,"And the airport wanted part of that, but they fought for it. But they can't take it.",
37:51:00,Interviewer:,Good. It's a sanctuary.,
37:52:00,Anne:,"Yeah, it's a sanctuary. And it's up near Suffolk Downs. Do you know what Suffolk Downs is? Okay.",
38:02:00,Interviewer:,Basically.,
38:02:00,Anne:,"It's on the right, and you have to walk in it. One time, we had an outdoor theater there. Around there. Years ago. Used to be a theater.",
38:12:00,Interviewer:,A drive-in.,
38:12:00,Anne:,"Yeah, a drive-in theater.",
38:15:00,Interviewer:,Did you go to the drive-in?,
38:17:00,Anne:,"Oh yeah, I did. A few times, but the airplanes- forget it.",
38:21:00,Interviewer:,"Oh, that's right.",
38:22:00,Anne:,"Okay, so they did away with it. At one time, East Boston had five theaters.",
38:26:00,Interviewer:,Oh really?,
38:27:00,Anne:,We don't have one today.,
38:29:00,Interviewer:,What happened?,
38:29:00,Anne:,"Not a theater in East Boston. We had a beautiful theater on Meridian Street near the library called the Seville Theater. Beautiful. It was all Spanish inside. It was called the Seville. And they had ceilings of stars, you could see them at night, and all that. Beautiful. Everything went. As a child, we had a theater called the Jem, down further Meridian Street.",
38:57:00,Interviewer:,J-E-M.,
38:58:00,Anne:,"J-E-M. It was five cents to get in. My father'd give us a quarter on Sundays. Five cents for the theater, five cents for a hot dog, five cents for a hamburger, and candy, and ice cream. We'd get all that for a quarter. At the Jem Theater. Then we had the Central Square Theater, and I was very young, but I recall we had four acts, shows-",
39:23:00,Interviewer:,It was like vaudeville! [crosstalk],
39:26:00,Anne:,"Plus two movies, and news, cartoons.",
39:30:00,Interviewer:,All in one place?,
39:31:00,Anne:,Ten cents.,
39:32:00,Interviewer:,Where was this theater?,
39:33:00,Anne:,It was on Bennington Street.,
39:34:00,Interviewer:,What was it called?,
39:35:00,Anne:,The Central Square Theater.,
39:36:00,Interviewer:,Oh my goodness.,
39:38:00,Anne:,"Now, they made a bowling alley out of it years later, now there's a parking area. Nobody knows what was there. And the Central Square Theater had four acts- Vaudeville.",
39:51:00,Interviewer:,Song and dance.,
39:52:00,Anne:,"Song and dance, piano players, and I hated the tap player. Someone would come on and start tapping, I couldn't stand it.",
39:58:00,Interviewer:,Really?,
40:01:00,Anne:,"Yeah, as young as I was. Maybe I didn't understand it. But the movies and all, I recall movies I would see there. Oh, ""The Great Waltz,"" it was a beautiful movie. And they would give you dishes out in front, on Monday night everybody went, dish night, and received dishware, for attending the theater.",
40:22:00,Interviewer:,"When was this, though? Because-",
40:24:00,Anne:,"Well, this is later on, in the 30s.",
40:26:00,Interviewer:,"Right, okay.",
40:27:00,Anne:,"In the 30s. But the vaudeville acts was, I was young, very young.",
40:31:00,Interviewer:,Okay.,
40:31:00,Anne:,"On Saturdays we had two shows. If you missed the first show, you waited in line for hours until the next show came out. And they did away with that. But it was a nice theater. The Central Square. Then they built the Seville after that.",
40:48:00,Interviewer:,Right afterwards.,
40:52:00,Anne:,"Yeah. And we had the Jem, then they had a theater up here, they had the Day Square Theater, and one up here. So that's one, two... there was another one, I don't recall... it was before my time. They said there was one on one of the side streets down there. But we don't have a theater in East Boston. And you could walk Meridian Street, it was beautiful.",
41:14:00,Anne:,"All the beautiful stores and shops, today there's nothing. There's one mark- we don't have a market up here.",
41:22:00,Interviewer:,Really.,
41:23:00,Anne:,"No. For years, we didn't- we had little 24-hour stores, you know, convenience stores-",
41:28:00,Interviewer:,You're talking about in Orient Heights.,
41:29:00,Anne:,"Now, yeah, right now. We don't have markets. No, they built a new Shaw's, down at the square. Lebanese Garden closed up. And, so I go every day shopping, just something to do. My daughter gets angry, says ""I can bring you an order."" I says ""No."" This way I get out.",
41:48:00,Interviewer:,"Well, it's important.",
41:49:00,Anne:,"Yeah, that I get out. But East Boston itself, the park was beautiful. As a little girl, I'd be down there- They'd have Mayflower- May Day. We'd go in the five-and-ten and buy tissue papers, put them on, make, you know, like a dress. And we'd have a Maypole, and we'd- we didn't have any goodies! And we kept the park beautiful. We were very careful. You couldn't sit down in the grass, the flowers, but now it's all gone. Nothing there. And that's gone, and then- I would love, on a Saturday morning, I'd go down to a horseshoe, they would shoe horses. Right near where the Liberty Market is now, and I'd sit there for hours watching them shoe horses. They would shoe them, the horse shoes, I used to love the smell of the shoe being put on the horse, of the hoof. And there were so many stores, and they're all gone. And I get sad when I go down there.",
42:57:00,Interviewer:,"Right, cause you- all the memories-",
43:03:00,Anne:,"I don't feel like, I don't like East Boston. I don't. My mother- Jack Kennedy's father, was president of a bank in East Boston, the Kennedys gave him the Point.",
43:11:00,Interviewer:,From which- from [inaudible 00:43:12] Point?,
43:13:00,Anne:,Jeffries Point.,
43:14:00,Interviewer:,"Oh, yes, Jeffries Point.",
43:16:00,Anne:,"They came from there. And his father was president of the bank in Maverick Square, my mother invested money in that bank, and the banks went sour.",
43:27:00,Interviewer:,Right.,
43:28:00,Anne:,My mother lost her money. She'd get like $5 a year or something.,
43:33:00,Interviewer:,"As sort of a recompensation- so when you say lost money, you're talking about during the crash-",
43:40:00,Anne:,Income. Well this was before the crash.,
43:43:00,Interviewer:,But the bank faltered?,
43:45:00,Anne:,"Yes, it did.",
43:46:00,Interviewer:,Why? Bad loans?,
43:46:00,Anne:,"Something happened. I don't know. No, I was still very young when it happened. Cause I recall my father telling my mother she didn't have a way to invest her money. At that time, it was some character called Ponzi, make fast money. My mother invested in that, and my father took a fit. She lost money- get rich quick!",
44:12:00,Interviewer:,"Right, and that's the word- quick.",
44:13:00,Anne:,"Yeah, it was a con job. People at the beginning did make money on it.",
44:17:00,Interviewer:,"Right, it's a pyramid scheme.",
44:20:00,Anne:,Yeah-,
44:20:00,Interviewer:,So people up here do. The people at the bottom don't.,
44:23:00,Anne:,"Right, exactly. Absolutely. So, I recall that.",
44:29:00,Interviewer:,But all of these little scams were before she got into real estate.,
44:33:00,Anne:,Right.,
44:33:00,Interviewer:,Cause it seems like she learned a few lessons.,
44:36:00,Anne:,"Oh yeah, she did. She did. Yeah, she sure did. So, that was our childhood. My mother, she worked hard, very hard, but my mother and father- my father was from a different- my mother loved the country. She came from the country, from Italy. And she loved country farming, she always had a garden, grew vegetables, and so forth. My father wasn't.",
45:05:00,Interviewer:,He's from the city?,
45:06:00,Anne:,"My father was- he came from the city. He came from a town called Foggia, I went there, it's a beautiful little city-",
45:12:00,Interviewer:,"Oh, you've been there?",
45:12:00,Anne:,"Oh yes, I went to Italy. I went to see my grandmother's grave, I was named after her. I was always called Nanina.",
45:20:00,Interviewer:,Nanina.,
45:22:00,Anne:,"That means ""little Anne."" Cause my grandmother's name was Anne. So I was called- my father came from brothers, he never had sisters, so I was named his mother-",
45:31:00,Interviewer:,You were the first girl?,
45:32:00,Anne:,I was the first girl. Right. And... I'm losing track of what I'm talking about. Oh-,
